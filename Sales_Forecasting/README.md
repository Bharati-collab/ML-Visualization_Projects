# Sales Forecasting & Seasonal Planning in Retail

## Overview
This project analyzes weekly sales patterns in a large retail chain (Walmart-like environment) to understand
holiday vs. non-holiday demand and support smarter inventory, staffing, and operational planning.
The analysis leverages business intelligence and data visualization to enable data-driven decision-making.

## Business Context
In a highly competitive retail landscape, holiday seasons introduce significant demand volatility.
Retailers often face challenges such as stockouts, overstocking, and inefficient labor allocation.
This project addresses the need for store-level visibility into seasonal sales behavior.

## Project Objectives
- Compare sales trends between holiday and non-holiday weeks  
- Identify top-performing and underperforming stores during holiday periods  
- Analyze the impact of external factors such as CPI, temperature, fuel prices, and unemployment  
- Deliver interactive Tableau dashboards for executive and store-level decision support  

## Tools & Skills
- Data Analysis & Preparation: Excel, Data Cleaning, Aggregation
- Business Intelligence & Visualization: Tableau (Interactive dashboards, filters, KPIs)
- Retail Analytics: Sales forecasting, seasonal trend analysis
- Analytical Techniques: Trend analysis, correlation analysis
- Business Skills: Data storytelling, operational insights, stakeholder communication

## Analytical Approach
- Cleaned and prepared weekly sales data with holiday classification
- Conducted exploratory trend analysis across time and stores
- Built store-level and executive dashboards with KPIs and filters
- Analyzed correlations between sales and external economic factors
- Designed role-specific views for leadership and store managers


## Key Insights
- Holiday weeks consistently drive significant sales spikes, with strong regional variation
- External factors such as CPI, unemployment, and temperature show measurable influence on sales
- Store-level performance differs substantially during peak seasons, requiring localized planning
- Interactive dashboards enable faster and more informed operational decisions

## Business Recommendations
- Align inventory and staffing strategies with store-specific holiday demand patterns
- Incorporate economic indicators into pre-holiday planning cycles
- Use dashboards proactively to anticipate demand rather than react to shortages
- Extend the solution with predictive modeling and real-time data integration

## Output
- Interactive Tableau dashboards for seasonal planning
- Store-level and executive views for operational and strategic use
